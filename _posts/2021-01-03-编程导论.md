## Different Errors
|Syntax errors|Logic errors|Semantic errors|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|A syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python.|A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another.|A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you intended for it to do. |  

## Elements of Python
* ### Reserved Words  
  the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We call this “vocabulary” the “reserved words”. These are words that have very specialmeaning to Python.You cannot use reserved words as variable names / identifiers.

* ### Sentences or Lines
1. A variable is a name that refers to a value.   
2. Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.   
3. Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings, are called “constants” because their value does not change.  
4. A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.  

## Interactive versus Script
* ### Interactive
  You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds. Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements ableto retrieve data created in earlier statements.
