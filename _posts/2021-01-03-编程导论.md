## Different Errors
* Syntax Errors  

|Syntax errors|Logic errors|Semantic errors|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|A syntax error means that you have violated the “grammar” rules of Python.|A logic error is when your program has good syntax but there is a mistake in the order of the statements or perhaps a mistake in how the statements relate to one another.|A semantic error is when your description of the steps to take is syntactically perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake in the program. The program is perfectly correct but it does not do what you intended for it to do. |
